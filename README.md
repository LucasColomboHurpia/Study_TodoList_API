# Study_TodoList_API
Study project around building and using APIs with Node.Js and Express. A working "to-do-list" that uses the localhost (wich is good enough for simulating real-time servers in this scale) to store and update information. Change the ip variable to your own if you wanna try it yourself!


Check packages.json to see wich modules were used! Express, Body-Parser and Cors
